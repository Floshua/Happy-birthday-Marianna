<!-- Paragraph reveal -->
<div id="paragraph-part-1" class="hidden paragraph">These last couple of months alone Ive try to further understand myself and the world, I mean that is sort of the main quest of life. I’ve tried so tantalisingly hard to contrive an axiom to lay my foundation of purposeful living on. That sounds like a wannabe intellectual word salad, but in short, the result of my efforts often leads me to the idea of death. I am still an edgelord to some degree, we are talking about me of course, but the conclusion of death I come to is not because I am some sad Bart xxxtentacion pfp enjoyer in a YouTube Shorts comment section. It is because the only thing that scares me more than the finite is the infinite. 
What is rare is inherently precious to us, it can be explained through basic biology and psychology, but simply, it is sometimes the vanishing that gives meaning to the appearance. Death is not rare by any means and yet it captivates me in a terrifying way. How can something so permanent, so common and true, yield such a firm place in a world full of debatable truths and subjective views. It is the only thing we all seem to agree on as a species. 
It is not the act of passing away that scares me so much, especially after being close a few times, but rather the notion that somehow my consciousness has to be stretched through infinity. I cannot ignore the idea of how even the longest moment of happiness or sadness, no matter how meaningful, against the face of infinity, dilutes to nothing. The idea of everything being stripped of its principles and values in the absurdity of infinity is a problem I keep thinking about for years. I am still working on it. I am not trying to say I am some grand thinker wrestling with God’s design as such, I am still pretty retarded, but that idea of what happens after death turns some cogs and lights the redstone in my two bit brain, cascading into other confluences of thought. 
Many ideas come and go but a strange thought flickers through me often. If I die, what would the ground make of me? What would I taste like to the earth? It is a little childish to think about, to personify the ground, possibly even just abstract for the sake of being different and “far out dude!!1!” but stick with me, there is more than just that nugget of corn in this lyrical cringemine. I often find myself wondering how the soil reacts as it draws me into the ground as I decompose. I imagine my flesh carries the iconic flavour of my gravel concoction and my organs very much the same, perhaps sharing that lull of a calorie dense nutty grit, or even laced with a subtle hint of something theatrically wacky just for the sake of absurdity and to stand out, full of the exaggerated swagger of an edgy Flynn, like a crippled monkey on a monastery floor dancing to the Zelda BOTW soundtrack or Joji. That sounds like a Family Guy cutaway doesn’t it? You’re picturing it I bet. 
Then my curiosity turns to my brain. What would it taste like? Do life experiences marinate the flavour of the brain? And further still, what of my soul? What taste, texture and consistency does it have? These questions splinter into so many facets it makes me feel like JJ after getting a mid grade, trying to play it off all bravado but still feeling like an overwhelmed and wounded child inside. “I didn’t even study I was on a late shift” yeah sure JJ, you and your Harvester job with all the milfs eyeing you out. I hope that guy is doing alright in life. 
Yet an answer to one question comes clearly to me. My heart. When I die, and the worms and the quiet detritus eaters of the dead reach my heart, I know without any doubt they taste you. 
I honestly and truly don’t want anything, you’re still very welcome to block me and have an amazing time in China, I’ll survive either way, the medication I’m on is keeping me in check. If anything what I get here is proof that not everything has to have purpose to matter so much, that love in its rawest form, exists so viscerally even when it asks for nothing in return. There’s something strange about how affection works. It’s so often built on the idea of deserving or earning, like there’s a hidden economy between hearts. But that’s not what real love or care actually is obviously. It isn’t transactional. It doesn’t weigh itself against what’s fair or what’s returned. It just exists, persistent and unbothered by logic. It’s like gravity. You don’t need to convince the ground to pull you back down. You don’t need to convince me to care about you. 
The reason people fear any emotion deeply is because it reminds them they don’t have control over it. Its psychology 101 and It’s humbling. It makes you face yourself in a way that’s uncomfortable, especially when you realise how much of love isn’t about being perfect or deserving, it’s about being known and seen even in the chaos. 
I find myself thinking about you through that lens often. You made me realise affection doesn’t need a reason or an outcome, it can just be. You helped me realise I don’t have to hyper intellectualise every emotions for it to still be logical rounded. I don’t feel like I owe you anything, and you don’t owe me anything, zilch nada nought. It’s not about wanting something in return, it’s about the way my soul really does just feels lighter knowing you exist Marianna. 
It’s why I adored smothering you with gifts so much, to me your value really is just ineffable, I can’t quantify it so I try my best to at least translate it into something to act as a conduit for how I feel. It sounds dragged out now for sure like I just want to keep overdoing myself for the sake of brownie points but there’s no audience to please because it was never a performance, it’s something infinitely abstract I wanted to try and manifest into reality for you.
